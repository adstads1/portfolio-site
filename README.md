# Portfolio Website

This portfolio website replaces my second version of my portfolio website created back in 2019, which you can find [here](https://adstads1.github.io/).

Click [here](https://adstads1.github.io/portfolio-site) to be redirected to my most updated live Portfolio Website. 

Feel free to use my work and code.
